About Tom Arnold (@geotom)
==========================

Currently, I am the GIS manager for [Walker Associates, Inc.](http://walkercivil.com) in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  My experience with geospatial applications began in 2004 while working for [Joseph E. Bonadiman and Associates](hhtp://www.bonadiman.com).

Favorite Software and Tools
---------------------------
So, what tools do I use?  Here is a partial list:
* [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)  
    An open source desktop GIS with plugin extensibility
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) / [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/)  
    A robust and powerful open source database system and its GIS extension
* [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) / [SpatiaLite](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/)  
    SQLite is a complete database and SQL engine in one self-contained, cross platform file.  SpatiaLite is a spatial extension for SQLite.  Seriously good stuff.
* [Python](http://www.python.org/)  
    An open source, object-oriented programming language.  A vast majority of GIS code libraries and API's have bindings for Python.
* [GDAL/OGR](http://www.gdal.org/)  
    A code library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats.
* [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)  
    A javascript code library for creating interactive web maps
