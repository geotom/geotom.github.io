My experience with geospatial applications began in 2004 while working for [Joseph E. Bonadiman and Associates](hhtp://www.bonadiman.com).\r\n\r\nFavorite Software and Tools\r\n---------------------------\r\nSo, what tools do I use?  Here is a partial list:\r\n* [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)  \r\n    An open source desktop GIS with plugin extensibility\r\n* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) / [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/)  \r\n    A robust and powerful open source database system and its GIS extension\r\n* [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) / [SpatiaLite](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/)  \r\n    SQLite is a complete database and SQL engine in one self-contained, cross platform file.  SpatiaLite is a spatial extension for SQLite.  Seriously good stuff.\r\n* [Python](http://www.python.org/)  \r\n    An open source, object-oriented programming language.  A vast majority of GIS code libraries and API's have bindings for Python.\r\n* [GDAL/OGR](http://www.gdal.org/)  \r\n    A code library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats.\r\n* [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)  \r\n    A javascript code library for creating interactive web maps\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
